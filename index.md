I'm Niels, and I like to write software tools that help humans make better decisions, particularly involving decision-making in routing and logistics.
I hold a PhD degree in operations research from the University of Groningen, and I also have a background in (ancient) history and econometrics.

> I am available for hire to work on routing problems, including research and implementation.
> If you have an exciting opportunity feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or [via email](mailto:niels@routinglab.tech).
