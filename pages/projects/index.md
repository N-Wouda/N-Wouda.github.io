# Current projects

- My first PhD project, on optimising supply chain network design problems under 
  supply and demand uncertainty. In particular, we develop and extend a decomposition
  approach based on row generation. Computation experiments show our extensions are
  much more performant than what's known so far. We will extend this project with a
  green hydrogen case study based on my master's thesis work.

# Past projects

A selection:

- A metaheuristic for an hourly learner timetabling problem arising in Dutch
  secondary education, when learners are scheduled by their preferences for
  various courses and modules (a variant of personalised learning).
  The repository is available [here](https://github.com/N-Wouda/PL-Heuristic).
  An article has been submitted for publication in _Computers and Operations Research_. 
  
- The [Rome Hinterland Project](http://comparativesurveyarchaeology.org/) (RHP)
  database. The RHP combines archaeological survey data collected over the past
  70 years in the territory of Rome to create the largest integrated regional
  dataset for the hinterland of any ancient Mediterranean city.
  <br>
  In early 2021, I gave two presentations about my work on the RHP. The first,
  [here](https://nielswouda.com/slides/rhp_tech), explains the implementation
  process. The second, [here](https://nielswouda.com/slides/rhp_user), explains
  several common queries one might perform.
  
- My master's thesis, on the planning of green hydrogen production on the Dutch North Sea.
  A slideshow is available [here](https://nielswouda.com/slides/msc_thesis/).

- A Python implementation of the adaptive large neighbourhood search (ALNS) metaheuristic.
  The package is available on the Python package index as `alns`; the repository is available [here](https://github.com/N-Wouda/ALNS).

- A simulation model and web application studying the feasibility of personalised
  learning in Dutch secondary education.
