# Current projects

- [nearing completion]
  My first PhD project, on optimising supply chain network design problems under 
  supply and demand uncertainty. We developed an exact solution approach based on
  row generation for this problem. Computation experiments show our method is much
  more performant than the current state-of-the-art. Using our method, we are
  currently investigating an interesting e-fuel network design problem arising
  in the Netherlands.

- [early phase] 
  A project optimising the scheduling of elective hours in Dutch secondary education.
  We are developing a scheduling algorithm that schedules electives based on (changing) learner needs.
 
# Past projects

A selection:

- A metaheuristic for an hourly learner timetabling problem arising in Dutch
  secondary education, when learners are scheduled by their preferences for
  various courses and modules (a variant of personalised learning).
  The repository is available [here](https://github.com/N-Wouda/PL-Heuristic).
  An article has been submitted for publication in _Computers and Operations Research_. 

- The [Rome Hinterland Project](http://comparativesurveyarchaeology.org/) (RHP)
  database. The RHP combines archaeological survey data collected over the past
  70 years in the territory of Rome to create the largest integrated regional
  dataset for the hinterland of any ancient Mediterranean city. We published 
  [a paper](https://doi.org/10.1017/eaa.2021.51) in the _European Journal of
  Archaeology_ motivating the need for the RHP database.
  <br>
  In early 2021, I gave two presentations about my work on the RHP. The first,
  [here](https://nielswouda.com/slides/rhp_tech), explains the implementation
  process. The second, [here](https://nielswouda.com/slides/rhp_user), explains
  several common queries one might perform.

- A Python implementation of the adaptive large neighbourhood search (ALNS) metaheuristic.
  The package is available on the Python package index as `alns`; the repository is available [here](https://github.com/N-Wouda/ALNS).

- A simulation model and web application studying the feasibility of personalised
  learning in Dutch secondary education.
