# Current projects

Most recently started first:

- [early]
  My second PhD project, on solving deterministic equivalent formulations of
  stochastic optimisation problems using column generation.

- [early] 
  A project optimising the scheduling of elective hours in Dutch secondary
  education. We are developing a scheduling algorithm that schedules electives 
  based on (changing) learner needs.

- [early]
  We are spinning off two papers from our work on the
  [EURO meets NeurIPS 2022 vehicle routing challenge](https://euro-neurips-vrp-2022.challenges.ortec.com/),
  where we finished in overall second place.
  The first paper describes our solution approach for the static variant (to be submitted to _INFORMS Journal on Computing_),
  and the second our solution approach for the dynamic variant (to be submitted to
  _Transportation Science_). More on this later in 2023.

- [nearing completion]
  My first PhD project, on optimising supply chain network design problems under
  supply and demand uncertainty. We developed an exact solution approach based on
  row generation for this problem. Computational experiments show our method is
  much more performant than the current state-of-the-art. Using our method, we are
  currently investigating an interesting e-fuel network design problem arising
  in the Netherlands.

# Past projects

A selection:

- I organised a team of motivated PhD candidates to join in the
  [EURO meets NeurIPS 2022 vehicle routing challenge](https://euro-neurips-vrp-2022.challenges.ortec.com/).
  Together, we developed algorithms solving two variants of a vehicle routing problem with time windows.
  Our team (OptiML) finished first on the static problem variant, and third on the dynamic, for an
  overall second place! The software repository is available [here](https://github.com/N-Wouda/Euro-NeurIPS-2022).

- A metaheuristic for an hourly learner timetabling problem arising in Dutch
  secondary education, when learners are scheduled by their demands or preferences
  for various courses and modules (a variant of personalised learning).
  We published [a paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2022.106089) in 
  _Computers & Operations Research_. The software repository is available 
  [here](https://github.com/N-Wouda/PL-Heuristic).

- The [Rome Hinterland Project](http://comparativesurveyarchaeology.org/) (RHP)
  database. The RHP combines archaeological survey data collected over the past
  70 years in the territory of Rome to create the largest integrated regional
  dataset for the hinterland of any ancient Mediterranean city. We published 
  [a paper](https://doi.org/10.1017/eaa.2021.51) in the _European Journal of
  Archaeology_ motivating the need for the RHP database.
  <br />
  In early 2021, I gave two presentations about my work on the RHP. The first,
  [here](https://nielswouda.com/slides/rhp_tech), explains the implementation
  process. The second, [here](https://nielswouda.com/slides/rhp_user), explains
  several common queries one might perform.

- A Python implementation of the adaptive large neighbourhood search (ALNS) 
  metaheuristic. The package is available on the Python package index as `alns`; 
  the repository is available [here](https://github.com/N-Wouda/ALNS). A paper
  has been submitted to the _Journal of Open Source Software_.
