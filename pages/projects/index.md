# Current projects

- A rather complete, solver-agnostic [SMPS parser in Python](https://github.com/N-Wouda/SMPS).
  This is foundational for benchmarking stochastic programming solvers, yet
  everyone seems to write their own half-baked implementations of such a parser 
  (the irony of me writing my own is not lost on me - 
  [obligatory XKCD](https://xkcd.com/927/)).

- The [Rome Hinterland Project](http://comparativesurveyarchaeology.org/) (RHP)
  database. The RHP combines archaeological survey data collected over the past 
  70 years in the territory of Rome to create the largest integrated regional 
  dataset for the hinterland of any ancient Mediterranean city.

- My master's thesis, on the planning of green hydrogen production on the Dutch
  North Sea.
