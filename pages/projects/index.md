# Ongoing projects

- PyVRP, a high-performance vehicle routing problem (VRP) solver that achieves exceptional performance on a number of VRP variants.
  The solver is written in C++ and Python, and available on the Python package index as `pyvrp`; the repository is available [here](https://github.com/PyVRP/PyVRP/).
  We published [a paper](https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.2023.0055) in _INFORMS Journal on Computing_.
  Work is ongoing to support additional VRP variants in new releases of PyVRP.

# Past projects

A selection:

- A project optimising waste collection for the Municipality of Groningen.
  We developed an efficient policy that integrates routing and waste container selection decisions based on available sensor data.
  In our simulation environment, this policy on average reduces routing costs by 40% while maintaining a high service level.
  We are currently investigating, with the municipality, whether we can bring this policy into practice.

- I organised a team of motivated PhD candidates to join in the [EURO meets NeurIPS 2022 vehicle routing challenge](https://euro-neurips-vrp-2022.challenges.ortec.com/).
  Together, we developed algorithms solving two variants of a vehicle routing problem with time windows.
  Our team (OptiML) finished first on the static problem variant, and third on the dynamic, for an overall second place!
  The software repository is available [here](https://github.com/N-Wouda/Euro-NeurIPS-2022).

- A metaheuristic for an hourly learner timetabling problem arising in Dutch secondary education, where learners are scheduled by their demands for various courses and modules (a variant of personalised learning).
  We published [a paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2022.106089) in _Computers & Operations Research_.
  The software repository is available [here](https://github.com/N-Wouda/PL-Heuristic).

- A Python implementation of the adaptive large neighbourhood search (ALNS) metaheuristic.
  The package is available on the Python package index as `alns`; the repository is available [here](https://github.com/N-Wouda/ALNS).
  We published [a paper](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.05028) in the _Journal of Open Source Software_.
