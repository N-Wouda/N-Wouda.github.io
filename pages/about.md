I'm Niels, and I like to write software tools that help make better decisions.
I have a BA in History (with a special interest in Roman economic history)
and a BSc in Econometrics and Operations Research. I am finishing up an MSc in
Operations Research (combining my interest in OR and applied mathematics with
courses on scientific computing and computer programming). I will start a PhD in
Operations Research in April/May 2021. All my degrees are from the University of
Groningen (NL).

This is a brief synopsis; a list of current and past projects is available 
[here](link://slug/projects).
