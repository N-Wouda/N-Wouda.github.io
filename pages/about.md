I'm Niels, and I like to write software tools that help make better decisions.
I obtained a BA in History (with a special interest in Roman economic history)
and a BSc in Econometrics and Operations Research in 2019. At the start of 2021, 
I completed an MSc in Operations Research. During my master's I combined my interest
in OR and applied mathematics with courses on scientific computing and computer 
programming. All my degrees are from the University of Groningen (NL).

In the Spring of 2021 I will start a PhD in Operations Research, again in Groningen.
