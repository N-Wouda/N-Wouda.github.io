I'm Niels, and I like to write software tools that help make better decisions.
I obtained a BA in History (with a special interest in Roman economic history) and a BSc in Econometrics and Operations Research in 2019.
At the start of 2021, I completed an MSc in Operations Research (cum laude).
During my master's I combined my interest in OR and applied mathematics with courses on scientific computing.
All my degrees are from the University of Groningen (NL).

In May 2021 I will start a PhD in Operations Research, again in Groningen. 

I am available for part-time freelancing work in web development (particularly e-commerce) and data analysis.
