This page contains a number of web pages I (re-)read often, or software packages
I frequently use.

# Essays and resources on programming

- Peter Norvig's classic _Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years_, [here](https://norvig.com/21-days.html).
- MIT's _The Missing Semester of Your CS Education_, [here](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/). 
- Ben Kuhn's _Essays on programming I think about a lot_, [here](https://www.benkuhn.net/progessays/).
  Equally interesting are the many blogs people reference in the comments.
- Robert L. Read's _How to be a Programmer_, [here](https://braydie.gitbooks.io/how-to-be-a-programmer/content/en/).
  I particularly like the long treatment of various soft skills, particularly in the
  "Intermediate" and "Advanced" sections of the book.
