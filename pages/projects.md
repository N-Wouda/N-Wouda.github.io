# Current projects

- A rather complete, solver-agnostic [SMPS parser in Python](https://github.com/N-Wouda/SMPS).
  This is foundational for benchmarking stochastic programming solvers, yet
  everyone seems to write their own half-baked implementations of such a parser 
  (the irony of me writing my own is not lost on me - 
  [obligatory XKCD](https://xkcd.com/927/)).

- The [Rome Hinterland Project](http://comparativesurveyarchaeology.org/) (RHP)
  database. The RHP combines archaeological survey data collected over the past 
  70 years in the territory of Rome to create the largest integrated regional 
  dataset for the hinterland of any ancient Mediterranean city.
  <br>
  In early 2021, I gave two presentations about my work on the RHP. The first,
  [here](https://nielswouda.com/slides/rhp_tech), explains the implementation 
  process. The second, [here](https://nielswouda.com/slides/rhp_user), explains 
  several common queries one might perform.

# Past projects

A selection:

- My master's thesis, on the planning of green hydrogen production on the Dutch North Sea.
  A slideshow is available [here](https://nielswouda.com/slides/msc_thesis/).
  I wrote my thesis during an internship at ORTEC.

- A Python implementation of the adaptive large neighbourhood search (ALNS) metaheuristic.
  The package is available on the Python package index as `alns`; the repository is available [here](https://github.com/N-Wouda/ALNS).

- A metaheuristic for a vehicle routing problem with complex loading constraints,
  using the `alns` package. The repository is available [here](https://github.com/N-Wouda/OR-Analysis).

- A metaheuristic for an hourly learner timetabling problem arising in Dutch
  secondary education, when learners are scheduled by their preferences for
  various courses and modules (a variant of personalised learning). This project 
  is a complete rewrite of my bachelor's thesis, and prompted me to write the
  `alns` package. The repository is available [here](https://github.com/N-Wouda/PL-Heuristic).

- A simulation model and web application studying the feasibility of personalised
  learning in Dutch secondary education.

- A serious game introducing inventory management and logistics to learners
  between ten and twelve years old. The game is available [here](http://ontdeklogistiek.nl/game/)
  (both in Dutch and English - switch languages via the menu).
