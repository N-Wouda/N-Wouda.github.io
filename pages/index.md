I'm Niels, and I like to write software tools that help humans make better decisions.
I hold a PhD degree in operations research from the University of Groningen, and I also have a background in (ancient) history and econometrics.

> I am occasionally available for hire to work on optimisation problems in logistics and/or e-commerce, including research and implementation.
> If you have an exciting opportunity related to any of these topics, feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or [via email](mailto:n.wouda@apium.nl).
