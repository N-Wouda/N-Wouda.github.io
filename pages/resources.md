This page contains a number of essays and books I (re-)read often, and software
packages I frequently use. I will add more as I remember them.

# Readings in programming

Various materials available online:

- Peter Norvig's classic _Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years_, [here](https://norvig.com/21-days.html).

- MIT's _The Missing Semester of Your CS Education_, [here](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/).

- Ben Kuhn's _Essays on programming I think about a lot_, [here](https://www.benkuhn.net/progessays/).
  Equally interesting are the many blogs people reference in the comments.
  
- Robert L. Read's _How to be a Programmer_, [here](https://braydie.gitbooks.io/how-to-be-a-programmer/content/en/).
  I like the long treatment of various soft skills, particularly in the
  "Intermediate" and "Advanced" sections of the book.

Physical books:

- GoF's _Design Patterns_. This is best read once or twice, and then kept as a
  reference book.
  
- Martin Fowler's _Refactoring_. Combined with GoF, this is a great resource on
  how to do OOP right, and improve the structure of existing code. 

- Kent Beck's _Test-Driven Development_. This book is short, to the point, and
  really hammers down the concepts of TDD. I often sin against the TDD premise 
  of "test first, code later", but do agree that (almost all) code should - and
  can - be supported by meaningful tests.
  
- Andrew Hunt and David Thomas' _The Pragmatic Programmer_. This book is a classic,
  touching upon many aspects of software development.

I am reading Eric Evans' _Domain-Driven Design_, aka the "blue book".
