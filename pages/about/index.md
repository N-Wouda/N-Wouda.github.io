I'm Niels, and I like to write software tools that help humans make better decisions.
I hold a master's degree in operations research (cum laude) from the University of Groningen, and I also have a background in ancient history and econometrics.
I am currently pursuing a PhD in operations research, having started in 2021.

I am available for part-time consulting work on optimisation problems in routing and dispatch and e-commerce settings, including research and implementation.
